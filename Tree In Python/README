Usage: python3 tree.py

This simple python script opens a given directory and lists its contents.
It opens a new recursion for each directory found, and closes the recursion after listing every file and directory inside the openned one.

Everything that has a "." in the name is judged as a file, and everything that doesn't is judged as a directory.
