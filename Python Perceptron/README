arq.txt is the training data used for the perceptron.

The perceptron's job is to classify if a given point in a cartesian field is "red" or "blue". Red points have x >= 0, regardless of what y coordinate. Blue points have x < 0, again, regardless of what y coordinate.

The perceptron was written in python 3, and just the training data included must suffice for whatever points, but you're welcome to change it however you want.
